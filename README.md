**How to use set tracker:**
- Use the `-` and `+` buttons to add and remove sets. Sets can be added even once the workout has begun, though you cannot remove completed sets.
- The red outline circle indicates the current set.
- Filled-in red circles indicate completed sets.
- A set is completed when the rest timer elapses.
- If the timer elapses after all sets have been completed, it will add its own completed set to the end.
